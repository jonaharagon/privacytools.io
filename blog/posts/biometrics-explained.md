# Biometrics Explained

Biometrics are a convenient and secure way to authenticate our devices. Many of us use and trust the biometrics of our devices without much thought, but are they really secure? With so many different types, which ones are the best?<!-- more -->

## Fingerprint

One of the most recognizable types of biometric authentication has to be the fingerprint reader. The idea is that everyone has a fairly unique fingerprint, so we should be able to distinguish between your fingerprint and someone else's reliably. (1)

1. :material-fingerprint: It's theorized that the reason humans have fingerprints in the first place is to [enhance our sense of touch](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1166467).

There four main ways we accomplish this: optical sensors, capacitive sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and thermal sensors.

### Optical Fingerprint Sensors

An optical sensor works just like you'd think it would: by taking a picture of your fingerprint and turning it into data. These are the cheapest and least secure option. They're potentially vulnerable to an attacker simply taking a picture of your fingerprint, since they only capture a two-dimensional image.

Many devices implement one of these sensors under the display, you can tell if you're does because it will flashbang you when you try to scan your finger. This happens so the optical sensor can capture a clear image of your finger.
