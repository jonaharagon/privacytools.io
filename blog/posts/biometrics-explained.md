# Biometrics Explained

Biometrics are a convenient and secure way to authenticate our devices. Many of us use and trust the biometrics of our devices without much thought, but are they really secure? With so many different types, which ones are the best?

## Fingerprint

One of the most recognizable types of biometric authentication has to be the fingerprint reader. The idea is that everyone has a fairly unique fingerprint, so we should be able to distinguish between your fingerprint and someone else's reliably.

As an aside, it's theorized that the reason humans have fingerprints in the first place is to [enhance our sense of touch](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1166467).
