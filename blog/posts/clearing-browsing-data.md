Your browsing data — such as cache, cookies, and browsing history — can accumulate over time, potentially damaging your privacy. Whether you trying to free up storage, limit tracking, or protect yourself from digital forensics, clearing browsing data is an important first step on your privacy journey. In this guide, we will explain how to clear your browsing data on three popular web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.<!-- more -->

## Understanding Browsing Data

Cookies are [small files that a website generates and sends to a browser](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/). They associate browsing activity to a given user session, allowing people to visit websites without logging in repeatedly. Cookies also facilitate [__personalization__](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/11/the-internet-of-you-how-web-personalization-is-shaping-the-future/), where websites "remember" your preferences and actions. Websites utilize personalization cookies to send targeted advertisements and track your location.

Website cache data [refers to offline website data that your browser stores](https://learn.g2.com/what-is-cached-data). By preloading content like webpages and images, subsequent visits to a website becomes faster. Unlike cookies, a cache does not expire and must be manually cleared. If you are concerned about [digital forensics](https://hawkeyeforensic.com/2024/03/30/browser-forensics-examining-browser-artifacts/), consider clearing it.

Similarly, your browsing history must be deleted. As its name suggest, your web browser keeps a record of all visited websites offline. Your [internet service provider could still view your history](https://www.androidauthority.com/isp-tracking-1167088/); however, you might want to prevent access from someone living with you.
