# Jonah Aragon Hired as Project Director

We are thrilled to announce a significant milestone for Privacy Guides: the addition of our first paid staff member, Jonah Aragon. This achievement is a testament to the unwavering support and generous donations from our incredible community. Another major donation came from [Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/){ rel=nofollow }, a privacy advocacy group that funds privacy-related research and development, which made this goal achievable earlier then expected!<!-- more -->

## A Community-Driven Success

The journey of Privacy Guides has always been fueled by the passion and contributions of our community. From the very beginning, our mission has been to provide reliable, independent information on privacy and security. Thanks to your donations, we are now able to take a significant step forward by bringing Jonah on board as our Project Director.

## Meet Jonah Aragon

Jonah Aragon is no stranger to Privacy Guides. As a founding member, Jonah has been instrumental in shaping our organization and its mission. With his extensive background in privacy and cybersecurity, Jonah brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to his new role.

## Jonah’s Role and Responsibilities

In his new position, Jonah will be working 20 hours a week to manage our day-to-day operations. His responsibilities will include overseeing various projects, ensuring smooth coordination among team members, and maintaining the high standards of our content and resources.

One of Jonah’s focuses will be restarting our “This Week in Privacy” podcast. This podcast has been a valuable resource for our community, providing weekly updates on the latest developments in the privacy world. After our initial trial run of this project, we heard your positive feedback, so we will be bringing it back!

## A Sustainable Future

Another crucial aspect of Jonah’s role will be fundraising. Our goal is to make this position self-sustaining, ensuring that Privacy Guides can continue to grow and thrive. Jonah’s efforts in fundraising will help secure the necessary resources to support our ongoing projects and initiatives.

## Thank You for Your Support

This exciting development would not have been possible without the incredible support of our community. Your donations have made it possible for us to bring Jonah on board and continue our mission of promoting privacy and security. We are deeply grateful for your trust and generosity.

As we embark on this new chapter, we look forward to the positive impact Jonah will have on Privacy Guides. Together, we will continue to advocate for privacy, educate the public, and provide valuable resources to help everyone protect their digital lives.
