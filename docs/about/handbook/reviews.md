title: Git Reviews

Anyone who is interested in helping us out is encouraged to leave reviews on GitHub, even if you are not a trusted reviewer yet. We primarily invite new reviewers based on a history of constructive *Requests for Changes* and appropriate *Approvals*.

[:material-github: How to Review a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

All changes to *privacyguides.org* are required to be reviewed and approved by **2** trusted reviewers, which is anyone granted write access to the repository.

## Basic Principles

There are a number of basic rules which apply to all [pull requests](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pulls) to *privacyguides.org*.

### 1. Community Interest

**When reviewing content you are acting as the voice of the community, not pushing forward your own agenda.** While ultimate approval will come down to you, always try to make your decision based on what is best for Privacy Guides and what is most aligned with community consensus.

It is generally not appropriate to use a Request for Changes to block an opinion you disagree with, if the change being made has been discussed and agreed to by the community, and there are no factual errors.

Likewise, it is generally not appropriate to Approve a PR which has no clear community consensus.

### 2. Prior Discussion

Pull requests which add new information to the website should always have an associated discussion on our [forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/c/site-development/7). The Pull Request description should link directly to that discussion. Pull Requests which have not been discussed within the community should be marked as `missing discussion` on GitHub and immediately closed. We can always re-open them later!

Please be respectful when communicating with Pull Request authors who are in violation of this rule. Many are first-time contributors who will be unaware of how we work here, or are familiar with other privacy-related projects which have much less stringent review criteria than we do. We want to keep these people involved with our community!

In some cases, Pull Requests are authored by the developer of the tool being suggested. Again, we want to keep these developers engaged and involved with the general privacy community, they can be the best people to direct feedback to after all. Please inform them of our [self-submission process](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/about-the-project-showcase-category/114), so they can be directly involved with the evaluation process.

Pull Requests which merely correct information on the website or make other non-editorial changes generally do not require prior discussion. In these cases the Pull Request description should clearly describe both what the changes being made are, **and why** the changes are being made.

### 3. Taking Ownership

When you add a review to a Pull Request, you are taking (at least partial) ownership of that PR. This means that you are committing to follow the PR from its current state to either it being merged or closed.

Please especially do not perform "drive by" requests for changes. You should follow all discussions in the PR regarding the changes you requested, and if the problems you identified have been resolved then you should change your review to an approval. Alternatively, if you still don't feel comfortable approving the PR then you may dismiss your review.

If you no longer wish to be involved with the PR, please dismiss your existing review.
