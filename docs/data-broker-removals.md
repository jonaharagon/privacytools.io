description: Our recommended methods for removing your personal information from data brokers and people search sites.

Counterintuitively, removing your personal data on these sites from the internet generally requires *providing* these companies with your personal data for them to comply with the request. Unfortunately, in most cases it is still worth doing so to minimize the amount of personal data about you which is publicly accessible.

## Manual Opt-Outs <small>Free</small>

The quickest, most effective, and most private way to remove yourself from people search sites is to submit opt-out requests manually to each site. This can *seem* like a daunting task, because there are hundreds of people search sites, but the reality is that the vast majority of these sites are operated by a small handful of companies.

You should search for your information on these 8 sites first, and submit an opt-out request if your information is found. Removing your data from these providers typically removes your data from many smaller sites at the same time.

- TruePeopleSearch
- Whitepages

Once you have done this, it's best to wait a week or two for the requests to propagate to all their sites. Then, you can start to search and opt-out of any remaining sites you find. It can be a good idea to use tools like [Optery](#optery-free--paid)'s free reports or [Google's *Results about you*](#google-results-about-you-free) tool to help find any data that remains on the internet.

If you don't use an automatic scanner to find results about you, consider setting a reminder to re-do this process every 3, 6, or 12 months depending on your risk level and the amount of personal data you have out there. Unfortunately, it is common for your data to re-appear over time or show up on brand new people search sites even after you opt-out.

**Optery** is a free scanning tool which will discover which people search sites have your personal information, provide you with a report of those sites, and link you directly to the self-service removal process to do manually. If you keep your account, the report will be updated quarterly. Optery also has paid plans available where they will submit opt-out requests automatically on your behalf.

## Google *Results About You* <small>Free</small>

This method will require you to submit your personal information to Google, for them to periodically monitor their search results for. Google claims to not use the information provided to this tool to "personalize your experiences" across other Google products.

**Results about you** is a free tool which helps you discover whether your personal contact information, including your home address, phone number, and email address, appear in Google search results. If any personal information is found, you can request its removal.

In many cases, a Google search is the first place a potential stalker or abuser would look to find your personal information, which could make using it a worthwhile trade-off. However, this tool does not remove your information from the discovered websites themselves, only their listings on Google. You should still consider manually opting out from the results which are discovered, or using another service which automatically opts you out from those sites directly.

You can add up to 3 addresses, 3 phone numbers, and 3 email addresses to your Google account to monitor for. The service is only available in select markets (initially the US and UK) to users over 18.

When results are found, they will be available for review in this web tool. You can also optionally receive an email notification letting you know when new results are found, delivered to the account's Gmail mailbox. You will then be able to click **Request to remove** on each discovered listing, and Google will review the request.

In our testing, this tool worked to reliably remove people search sites from Google search results, but was not effective against websites that showed *corporate* filing information, even if you used your personal address to register a company, nor social media profiles.
