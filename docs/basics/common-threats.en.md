title: "Common Threats"

Broadly speaking, we categorize our recommendations into seven categories of threats or goals that apply to most people. You may be concerned with one, a few, or all of these possibilities, and the tools and services you use depends on what your goals are. You may also have specific threats outside of these categories as well, which is perfectly fine! The important part is developing an understanding of the benefits and shortfallings of the tools you choose to use, because virtually none of them will protect you from every threat imaginable.

- <span class="pg-purple" title="Protects your activities from being tied to your real-life identity">:fontawesome-solid-user-secret: Anonymity</span> - Tools that provide anonymity allow you to completely shield your online activity from your real-life identity, protecting you from people who are trying to uncover your identity specifically.
- <span class="pg-red" title="Protects you from malicious agents targeting you specifically">:material-target-account: Targeted Attacks</span> - Using tools which protect you from dedicated hackers or other malicious agents trying to gain access to *your* data or devices specifically.
- <span class="pg-orange" title="Protects you from malware and other untargeted attacks">:material-bug-outline: Untargeted Attacks</span> - Using tools which protect you from things like malware, phishing campaigns, and other attacks that are made against many people at once.
- <span class="pg-teal" title="Protects your data from being readable by your service provider">:material-server-network: Service Providers</span> - Using tools which protect your data from service providers, e.g. with end-to-end encryption rendering your data unreadable to the server.
- <span class="pg-blue" title="Protects you from mass surveillance programs">:material-eye-outline: Mass Surveillance</span> - Using tools that protect you from government agencies, organizations, websites, and services working together to track your activities.
- <span class="pg-brown" title="Protects you from big tech companies and advertising network tracking">:material-advertisements: AdTech Tracking</span> - Related to both service providers and mass surveillance programs, you may wish to use tools which protect you from Big Tech companies or Advertising Networks specifically, although non-commercial/governmental surveillance programs can still be more pervasive.
- <span class="pg-green" title="Protects your data from being publicly accessible">:material-account-search: Public Exposure</span> - Limiting the information about you online that is accessible to search engines or the general public.

Some of these threats may weigh more than others. For example, a software developer might have a hacker as their primary threat, but beyond that they would also want privacy from the websites they visit and so on. Likewise, an average Joe may have mass surveillance programs and service provider data access as their primary threat, but beyond that they also need to have decent security to prevent malware from stealing their data.

## Anonymity vs Privacy

<span class="pg-purple" title="Protects your activities from being tied to your real-life identity">:fontawesome-solid-user-secret: Anonymity</span>

Anonymity is often confused for privacy, but it's a distinct concept. While privacy is a set of choices you make about how your data is used and shared, anonymity is the complete disassociation of your online activities from your real-life identity.

Whistleblowers and journalists, for example, can have a much more extreme threat model requiring total anonymity. That's not only hiding what they do, what data they have, and not getting hacked by hackers or governments, but also hiding who they are entirely. They will sacrifice any kind of convenience if it means protecting their anonymity, privacy, or security, as their lives could depend on it. Most regular people do not need to go so far.

## Privacy From Service Providers

We live in a world where almost everything is connected to the internet. Our "private" messages, emails, social interactions are typilically stored on a server somewhere. Generally, when you send someone a message, that message is then stored on a server, and when your friend wants to read the message, the server will show it to them.

The obvious problem with this model is that the service provider, the server operator, or a hacker who has compromised the server can look into your "private" conversations whenever and however they want to do it, without you ever knowing. Privacy policies are not to be trusted, as they are nothing more than a pinky promise that you cannot verify. This applies to common services like Discord, non "Secret Chat" on Telegram, SMS messages, and so on.

We need something better. Thankfully, we could use end to end encryption to eliviate this issue. In a typical end to end encrypted setup, both users will generate a pair of asymetric encryption keys - a public and private key. One person can encrypt a message
