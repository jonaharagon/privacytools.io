# First Steps After Being Hacked

## Turn Off Your Device

Whatever malware you're infected with can't run if your device is off. This is especially important with ransomware. The faster you interrupt the software encrypting your files, the more of your files you can save. You can also prevent the malware from spreading to other devices in your network or from sending itself over the internet.

## Check to Make Sure you Have Backups

Hopefully you backed up your important data beforehand to an external location.
