# First Steps After Being Hacked

## Turn Off Your Device

Whatever malware you're infected with can't run if your device is off. Unplug the power, ethernet cable, anything connected to your device.

This is especially important with ransomware. The faster you interrupt the software encrypting your files, the more of your files you can save. You can also prevent the malware from spreading to other devices in your network or from sending itself over the internet.

If your device is a phone, it very likely has Verified Boot and turning it off and on again will prevent malware from loading.

In the event of ransomware, ==**never** pay the ransom.== There's no guarantee you'll get your data back and it only encourages criminal behavior.

## Check to Make Sure you Have Backups

Hopefully you backed up your important data beforehand to an external location. If you didn't, you can try to make a [bootable Linux drive](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) that you can boot into and see what files are still intact. ==You should use a known-good computer to make this drive, and keep your infected computer disconnected from everything except power while it's turned on. **DO NOT** connect to Wi-Fi.==

If you don't have access to another computer, you can bring a flash drive to a computer shop and they should make one for free if you ask them to.

While you are booted into linux, move all files you want to save onto an external drive. When you're done, shut down your computer fully and unplug it again.

## Reinstall Your Operating System

You'll want a clean install of your operating system. The process will vary for each one, so you should consult your operating system's documentation. Generally, you should use a USB drive and boot into it to wipe your old OS and install a fresh one, although not all operating systems allow this.

## Set up Your New OS

Now that you've installed a fresh operating system, you'll need to set it up how you want it. This can be a painful process; let it be a lesson to be more careful next time.
