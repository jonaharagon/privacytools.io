Passwords are an essential part of our everyday digital lives. We use them to protect our accounts, our devices and our secrets. Despite often being the only thing between us and someone who wants to access our private information, not a lot of thought is put into them, often leading to using passwords that can be easily guessed or brute-forced and thus jeopardizing your most important data.

## Best Practices

### Use unique passwords for every service

### Randomly generate your passwords

### When you should change your password, and when you shouldn't

## Creating strong passwords

### Diceware

## Storing Passwords

### Password Managers

The best way to store your passwords is by using a password manager. They allow you to store your passwords in a file or in the cloud with the use of a master password. That way, you will only have to remember one strong password, which lets you access the rest of them.

There are many good options to choose from, both cloud-based and local. Choose one of our recommended password managers and use it to establish strong passwords across all of your accounts. We recommend securing your password manager with a 8-10 word [diceware](#diceware) passphrase.
