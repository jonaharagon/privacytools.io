Passwords are an essential part of our everyday digital lives. We use them to protect our accounts, our devices and our secrets. Despite often being the only thing between us and someone who wants to access our private information, not a lot of thought is put into them, often leading to using passwords that can be easily guessed or brute-forced and thus jeopardizing your most important data.
