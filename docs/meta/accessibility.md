At Privacy Guides, we strive to make our website as accessible as possible so we can reach everyone with our message.

Try to follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.wcag.com) as closely as possible when contributing to the site.

You can use this [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify colors meet the guidelines.

Make sure to use html/markdown elements instead of images/emojis when possible, for example for checkboxes you should use

`- [x]` which will render as

- [x]

Don't use
