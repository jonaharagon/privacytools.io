At Privacy Guides, we strive to make our website as accessible as possible so we can reach as many people as possible.

## Guidelines

Try to follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.wcag.com) as closely as possible when contributing to the site.

You can use this [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify colors meet the guidelines.

Make sure to use html/markdown elements instead of images/emojis when possible, for example for checkboxes you should use

`- [x]` which will render as

- [x] 



Don't use

:white_check_mark:

This will be easier for things like screenreaders to interpret.

## Company Logos

Sometimes a company logo will not show up well in either light mode or dark mode. In these cases, try to find a version of the logo that looks good in both light and dark modes or see if they have different versions of the logo for light and dark mode.

It never hurts to contact the developers and ask if you can't find the proper logos.
