macOS provides great security out-of-the-box. With some tweaks, you can tailor it to your privacy needs.

## Hardware

Security features like Verified Boot rely on Apple's hardware to function properly. For this reason, we recommend you only run it on Macs and avoid hackintoshes.

Apple's newer hardware always has the best security; you should check to make sure the Mac you're buying has at least their M1 chip, as their intel Macs are vulnerable to the [checkm8](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit) exploit.

If you use bluetooth accessories such as a keyboard, we recommend that you use official Apple ones as their firmware will automatically be updated for you by macOS. Using third party accessories is fine, but you should remember to install firmware updates for them regularly.
