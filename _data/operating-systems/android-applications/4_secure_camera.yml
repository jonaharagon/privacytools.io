  **Secure Camera** is an camera app focused on privacy and security which can capture images, videos, and QR codes. CameraX vendor extensions (Portrait, HDR, Night Sight, Face Retouch, and Auto) are also supported on available devices.

  Main privacy features include
  - Auto stripping of [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) metadata (enabled by default)
  - Use of the new [Media](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media) API, therefore [storage permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage) are not required
  - Microphone permission not required unless you want to record sound

  ### Notes
  Metadata is not currently stripped from video files but that is planned.

  The orientation metadata is not stripped, and if you enable location that is not stripped as well.
