  **Shelter** is an app that helps you leverage the Android work profile to isolate other apps.

  Shelter supports blocking contact search cross profiles and sharing files across profiles via the default file manager ([DocumentsUI](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system/documentsui)).

  #### Notes
  CalyxOS includes a device controller so we recommend using their built in work profile instead.

  Trust of the device controller (Shelter) is important as it has extensive privileges.
