  **Shelter** is an app that helps you leverage the Android work profile to isolate other apps.

  Shelter supports blocking contact search cross profiles and sharing files across profiles via the default file manager ([DocumentsUI](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system/documentsui)).

  #### Notes
  As CalyxOS includes a device controller, we recommend using their built in work profile instead.

  Shelter is recommended over [Insular](https://secure-system.gitlab.io/Insular/) and [Island](https://github.com/oasisfeng/island) as it supports [contact search blocking](https://secure-system.gitlab.io/Insular/faq.html).

  When using Shelter, you are placing complete trust in its developer as Shelter would be acting as a [Device Admin](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin) for the work profile and has extensive access to the data stored within it.
