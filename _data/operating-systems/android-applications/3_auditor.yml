  <strong>Auditor</strong> is an app which leverages hardware security features to provide device integrity monitoring for <a href="https://attestation.app/about#device-support">supported devices</a>. It currently works with GrapheneOS and the stock operating system. It performs attestation and intrusion detection by:
  <ul>
    <li>Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use">Trust On First Use (TOFU)</a> model between an <em>auditor</em> and <em>auditee</em>, the pair establish a private key in the <a href="https://source.android.com/security/keystore/">hardware-backed keystore</a> of the <em>Auditor</em>.</li>
    <li>The <em>auditor</em> can either be another instance of the Auditor app or the <a href="https://attestation.app">Remote Attestation Service</a>.</li>
    <li>The <em>auditor</em> records the current state and configuration of the <em>auditee</em>.</li>
    <li>Should tampering with the operating system of the <em>auditee</em> after the pairing is complete, the auditor will be aware of the change in the device state and configurations.</li>
    <li>The user will be alerted to the change.</li>
  </ul>

  No personally identifiable information is submitted to the attestation service. We recommend that you sign up with an anonymous account and enable remote attestation for continuous monitoring.

  If your <a href="/threat-modeling/">threat model</a> requires privacy you could consider using Orbot or a VPN to hide your IP address from the attestation service.

  To make sure that your hardware and operating system is genuine, <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web#verifying-installation">perform local attestation</a> immediately after the device has been installed and prior to any internet connection.
