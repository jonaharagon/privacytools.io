  <strong>Orbot</strong> is a free proxy app that routes your connections through the Tor Network.

  Orbot can proxy individual apps if they support SOCKS or HTTP proxying. It can also proxy all your network connections using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService">VpnService</a> and can be used with the VPN killswitch (⚙️ Settings → Network & internet → VPN → ⚙️ → Block connections without VPN).

  For resistance against traffic analysis attacks, consider enabling <em>Isolate Destination Address</em> ( ⁝ →Settings → Connectivity). This will use a completely different Tor Circuit (different middle relay and exit nodes) for every domain you connect to.

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  Orbot is often outdated on the Guardian Project's <a href="https://guardianproject.info/fdroid">F-Droid repository</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android">Google Play</a> so consider downloading directly from the <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot">GitHub repository</a> instead.

  All versions are signed using the same signature so they should be compatible with each other.
