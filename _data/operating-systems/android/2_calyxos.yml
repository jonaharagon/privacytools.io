  **CalyxOS** is a decent alternative to GrapheneOS.

  It has some privacy features on top of AOSP, including [Datura firewall](https://calyxos.org/docs/tech/datura-details), [Signal](https://signal.org) integration in the dialer app, and a built in panic button. CalyxOS also comes with firmware updates and signed builds, so [verified boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot) is fully supported.

  To accomodate users who need Google Play Services, CalyxOS optionally includes [MicroG](https://microg.org/). With MicroG, CalyxOS also bundles in the [Mozilla](https://location.services.mozilla.com/) and [DejaVu](https://github.com/n76/DejaVu) location services.

  Currently, CalyxOS only supports [Pixel phones](https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support/).

  #### Notes
  CalyxOS's "extended support" does not have full security patches due to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) discontinuing support; therefore, they cannot be considered completely secure.
