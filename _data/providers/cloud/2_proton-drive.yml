  <strong>Proton Drive</strong> is an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) general file storage service by the popular encrypted email provider <a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a>.

  Proton Drive is currently in beta and only is only available through a web client.

  When using a web client, you are placing trust in the server to send you proper JavaScript code to derive the decryption key and authentication token locally in your browser. A compromised server can send you malicious JavaScript code to steal your master password and decrypt your data. If this does not fit your <a href="/threat-modeling/">threat model</a>, consider using an alternative.
