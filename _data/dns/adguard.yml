    We store aggregated performance metrics of our DNS server, namely the number of complete requests to a particular server, the number of blocked requests, the speed of processing requests.
    We keep and store the database of domains requested in the last 24 hours. We need this information to identify and block new trackers and threats.
    We also log how many times this or that tracker has been blocked. We need this information to remove outdated rules from our filters.
