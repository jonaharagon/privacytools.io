  **uBlock Origin** is a popular content blocker that could help you block ads, trackers, and fingerprinting scripts.

  We suggest enabling all of the [filter lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists) under the "Ads," "Privacy," and "Malware domains". The "Annoyances" and "Multipurpose" lists can also be enabled, but they may break some social media functions. The *AdGuard URL Tracking Protection* filter list makes extensions like CleanURLs and NeatURLs redundant.

  We also suggest adding the [Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt) list and any of the regional lists that might apply to your browsing habits. To add this list, first access settings by clicking on the uBO icon, then the settings icon (⚙️). Go to the bottom of the Filter lists pane and place a checkmark next to Import under the Custom section. Paste the URL of the filter list above into the text area that appears below and click "Apply changes".

  Additional filter lists do slow things down and may increase your [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface), so only apply what you need.

  uBlock Origin also has different [blocking modes](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode). The easy mode [might not](https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/) necessarily keep you safe from every tracker out there, whereas the more advanced modes let you control exactly what needs to run.
