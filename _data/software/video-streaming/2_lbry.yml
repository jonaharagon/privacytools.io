  <strong>The LBRY network</strong> is a decentralized video sharing network. It uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent">Torrent</a> like network to store the video content, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> to store the indexes for those videos. The main advantage of such design is it's censorship resistance.

  <strong>The LBRY desktop client</strong> helps you stream videos from the LBRY network, and stores your subscription list in your own LBRY wallet.

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  We recommend <strong>against</strong> synchronizing your wallet with LBRY Inc. at the moment, as synchronizing encrypted wallets is not supported yet. If you synchronize your wallet with LBRY Inc., you have to trust them to not look at your subscription list, <a href="https://lbry.com/faq/earn-credits">LBC</a> funds, or take control of your channel.

  Only the <strong>LBRY desktop client</strong> is recommended. <a href="https://odysee.com/">Odysee</a> and the F-Droid, Play Store, IOS clients have mandatory synchronization and telemetry.

  While watching and hosting videos, your IP address is visible to the LBRY network. Consider using a <a href='/providers/vpn/'>VPN</a> depending on your <a href="/threat-modeling/">threat model</a>. You could also disable <em>Save hosting data to help the LBRY network</em> option (⚙️ Settings → Advanced Settings) to avoid exposing your IP and watched videos for a prolonged period of time.
