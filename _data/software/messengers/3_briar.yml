  **Briar** is an encrypted instant messenger that [connects](https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/) to other clients using the Tor Network. Briar can also connect via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth when in local proximity. Briar's local mesh mode can be useful when internet availability is a problem.

  #### Notes
  To [add a contact](https://briarproject.org/manual/) on Briar, you must both add each other first. You can either exchange `briar://` links or scan a contact's QR code if they are nearby.

  #### Technical information
  The client software was independently [audited](https://briarproject.org/news/2017-beta-released-security-audit/) and the anonymous routing protocol uses the Tor network which has also been audited.

  Briar has a fully [published specification](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec).

  Briar supports perfect forward secrecy by using the Bramble [Handshake](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BHP.md) and [Transport](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BTP.md) protocol.
