  <strong>Briar</strong> is an encrypted instant messenger that <a href="https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/">connects</a> to other clients using the Tor Network. Briar can also connect via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth when in local proximity. Briar's local mesh mode can be useful when internet availability is a problem.

  <h4>Notes</h4>

  <h4>Technical information</h4>
  The client software was independently <a href="https://briarproject.org/news/2017-beta-released-security-audit/">audited</a> and the anonymous routing protocol uses the Tor network which has also been audited.

  Briar has a fully <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec">published specification</a>.

  Briar supports perfect forward secrecy by using the Bramble <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BHP.md">Handshake</a> and <a href="https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-spec/blob/master/protocols/BTP.md">Transport</a> protocol.
