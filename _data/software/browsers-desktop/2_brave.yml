  <strong>Brave</strong> is built upon the Chromium browser, featuring a built in adblocker and some <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-features/">privacy features</a> enabled by default.

  We only recommend Brave as a desktop browser. There are better <a href="/browsers/#mobile-only-recommendations">alternatives on mobile platforms</a>.

  <h5><strong>Shields</strong></h5>
  Change the adblocker to agressive mode (≡ Settings → Shields → Trackers & ads blocking).

  Change the fingerprinting blocker to strict mode (≡ Settings → Shields → Fingerprint blocking). You can always downgrade it if you need to. We <strong>do not</strong> believe the <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/4-fingerprinting-defenses-2.0/">fingerprint protection</a> Brave offers is as strong as that of a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting">well-configured Firefox</a>.

  <h5><strong>Social media blocking</strong></h5>
  Disable social media components (≡ Settings → Social media blocking -> Uncheck all options).

  <h5><strong>Privacy and Security</strong></h5>
  There are a few options in here you may want to change.

  <ul>
    <li>Set the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017989132-How-do-I-change-my-Privacy-Settings-#webrtc">WebRTC IP Handling Policy</a> to <em>Disable Non-Proxied UDP</em> (≡ Settings → Privacy and Security → WebRTC IP handling policy).</li>
    <li>Enable https everywhere (≡ Settings → Privacy and Security → Security → Always use secure connections)</li>
  </ul>

  <h5><strong>Sanitizing on close</strong></h5>
  Select every option in clear browsing data on exit except <em>Site and Shields settings</em> (≡ Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data → On exit).

  <h5><strong>Extensions</strong></h5>
  Disabe all extensions which you do not use (≡ Settings → Extensions). You should not use the Tor tab in Brave. Brave is <strong>not</strong> as resistant to fingerprinting as the Tor Browser and will make you stand out.

  <h5><strong>IPFS</strong></h5>
  InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed filesystem. Unless you use it, consider disabling this (≡ Settings → IPFS → Method to resolve IPFS resources).

  <h5><strong>Background apps</strong></h5>
  Disable background apps (≡ Settings → System → Continue running apps when Brave is closed).
