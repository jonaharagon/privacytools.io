  **Firefox** provides strong privacy settings such as [Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop), which can help block various [types of tracking](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks).

  These options can be found in the *Privacy & Security* settings page ( ‚â° ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security).

  </ul>

  ##### **HTTPS-Only Mode**
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Select: <strong>Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  You can still stay logged into websites by allowing exceptions.

  #### Extensions
  We normally do not recommend installing any extensions as they have privileged access within your browser. We make an exception for [uBlock Origin](/browsers/#additional-resources),
  a popular content blocker and üèÜÔ∏è [Recommended Extension](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/add-on-badges#w_recommended-extensions) by Mozilla.

  #### Arkenfox (advanced)
  The [Arkenfox project](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) provides a set of carefully considered options for Firefox. These options are quite strict but a few are subjective and may cause some websites to not work properly. You can easily change these settings to suit your needs. We **strongly recommend** reading through their [wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki). Arkenfox also enables [container](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers#w_for-advanced-users) support.
