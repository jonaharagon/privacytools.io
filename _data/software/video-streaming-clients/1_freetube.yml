  <strong>FreeTube</strong> is a free and open source desktop application for <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>. When using FreeTube, your subscription list and playlists are saved locally on your device.

  FreeTube also features <a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app">SponsorBlock</a> to help you skip sponsored advertisements. All YouTube advertisements are also blocked by default.

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  When using Freetube, your IP address is still known to YouTube, <a href="https://instances.invidious.io">Invidious</a> and the SponsorBlock instances that you use. Consider using a <a href='/providers/vpn'>VPN</a> or <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> if your <a href="/threat-modeling">threat model</a> requires hiding your IP address.
