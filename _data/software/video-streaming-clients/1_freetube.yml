  **FreeTube** is a free and open source desktop application for [YouTube](https://youtube.com). When using FreeTube, your subscription list and playlists are saved locally on your device.

  FreeTube also features [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) to help you skip sponsored advertisements. All YouTube advertisements are also blocked by default.

  #### Notes
  When using Freetube, your IP address is still known to YouTube, [Invidious](https://instances.invidious.io) and the SponsorBlock instances that you use. Consider using a [VPN](/providers/vpn) or [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) if your [threat model](/threat-modeling) requires hiding your IP address.
