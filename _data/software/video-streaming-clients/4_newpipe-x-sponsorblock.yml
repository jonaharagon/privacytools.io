  **NewPipe x SponsorBlock** is a fork of [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net) with [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) integrated to help you skip sponsored advertisements.
  It also has some experimental settings such as the ability to use the built-in player for local playback, an option to force fullscreen on landscape mode, and an option to disable error reporting prompts.

  #### Notes
  This fork is not endorsed by or affiliated with the upstream project. The NewPipe team has [rejected](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3205) integration with SponsorBlock and thus this fork is created to provide this functionality.
