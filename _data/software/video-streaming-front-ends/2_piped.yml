  **Piped** is a free and open source front end for YouTube that is also self-hostable.

  #### Use case
  Piped is useful if you want to use SponsorBlock without installing an extension and access age-restricted content without an account. It does not provide privacy by itself and we donâ€™t recommend logging into any accounts.

  #### Notes
  Invidious does not proxy the video stream through its server by default. Videos watched through Invidious will still make direct connections to Google's servers (googlevideo.com), however, some instances support video proxying. This can be enabled by adding `&local=true` to the URL.

  When self-hosting, it is important that you have other people using your instance as well in order for you to blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting Invidious, as other peoples' usage will be linked to your hosting.

  When you are using an Invidious instance, be sure to go read the Privacy Policy of that specific instance. Invidious instances can be modified by their owners and therefore may not reflect their associated privacy policy. Some instances have Tor .onion addresses which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries don't contain PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
