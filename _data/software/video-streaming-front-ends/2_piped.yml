  **Piped** is a free and open source front end for YouTube that is also self-hostable.

  #### Use case
  Piped is useful if you want to use SponsorBlock without installing an extension and access age-restricted content without an account. It does not provide privacy by itself and we donâ€™t recommend logging into any accounts.
