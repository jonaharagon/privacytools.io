  **Safari** is the default browser in iOS. It includes [privacy features](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85/15.0/ios/15.0) such as Intelligent Tracking Protection, Privacy Report, isolated Private Browsing tabs, iCloud Private Relay, and automatic HTTPS upgrades.

  These options can be found in *Privacy and Security* (⚙️ Settings → Safari → Privacy and Security).

  ##### **Cross-Site Tracking Prevention**
  Toggling this setting enables WebKit's [Intelligent Tracking Protection](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/#intelligent-tracking-prevention-itp).

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Toggle On: <strong>Prevent Cross-Site Tracking</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  ##### **Privacy Report**
  Privacy Report provides a snapshot of cross-site trackers currently prevented from profiling you on the website you're visiting. It can also display a weekly report to show which trackers have been blocked over time.

  Privacy Report is accessible through the **Aa** icon in the URL bar.

  ##### **Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement**
  This is WebKit's own [implementation](https://webkit.org/blog/8943/privacy-preserving-ad-click-attribution-for-the-web/) of privacy preserving ad click attribution. If you do not wish to participate, you can disable this feature.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Toggle Off: <strong>Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  ##### **Apple Pay**
  If you do not use Apple Pay, you can toggle off the ability for websites to check for it.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Toggle Off: <strong>Check for Apple Pay</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  ##### **Always-on Private Browsing**
  Open Safari and press the tabs icon in the bottom right corner. Open Tab Groups, located in the bottom middle.

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;padding-left:0;">
    <li>Select: <strong>Private</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  #### iCloud Sync
  While synchronization of Safari History, Tab Groups, and iCloud Tabs is end-to-end encrypted, bookmarks are [not](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303); they are only encrypted in transit and stored in an encrypted format on Apple's servers. Apple may be able to decrypt and access them.

  If you use iCloud, we also recommend checking to ensure Safari's default download location is set to locally on your device. This option can be found in *General* (⚙️ Settings → Safari → General → Downloads).

  #### Extensions
  We generally do not recommend installing [any extensions](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/inside-safari-extensions-malware-golden-key-user-data/) as they increase your browser's [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface); however, if you want content blocking, [AdGuard for Safari](/browsers/#additional-resources) might be useful to you.
