  **Firefox** Focus iOS includes [Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-ios) which lets you select blocklists for ad trackers, analytic trackers, social trackers and other content tracking.

  Focus also destroys browsing history on quit automatically. This is a good way of automatically clearing cookies and website data regularly which is helpful to prevent tracking.

  ##### **Sanitizing on close**
  Focus sanitizies all data on close by default. Pressing on the <img alt="iOS Garbage Bin icon" width="16" height="16" src="/assets/img/browsers/ios-trash.svg"/> <img_dark alt="iOS Garbage Bin icon" width="16" height="16" src="/assets/img/browsers/ios-trash-dark.svg"/> will immediately destroy all cookies and website data for the entire session.

  #### Notes
  Focus only lets you open one tab at a time.
