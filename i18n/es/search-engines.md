Utilice un motor de b√∫squeda que no construya un perfil publicitario basado en sus b√∫squedas.

Las recomendaciones aqu√≠ se basan en los m√©ritos de la pol√≠tica de privacidad de cada servicio. No hay **garant√≠as** de que estas pol√≠ticas de privacidad se respetan.

Considera usar un [VPN](/vpn) o [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) si tu modelo de amenaza requiere ocultar tu direcci√≥n IP al proveedor de b√∫squedas.

SearXNG is a proxy between you and the search engines it aggregates from. recommendation

When self-hosting, it is important that you have other people using your instance so that the queries would blend in. note

When you are using a SearXNG instance, be sure to go read their privacy policy. recommendation Some instances run as a Tor hidden service, which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries does not contain PII.

    **Startpage** is a private search engine known for serving Google search results.  One of Startpage's unique features is the [Anonymous View](https://www.startpage.com/en/anonymous-view/), which puts forth efforts to standardize user activity to make it more difficult to be uniquely identified. The feature can be useful for hiding [some](https://support.startpage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4455540212116-The-Anonymous-View-Proxy-technical-details) network and browser properties. Unlike the name suggests, the feature should not be relied upon for anonymity. If you are looking for anonymity, use the [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) instead.

!!! warning

    Startpage regularly limits service access to certain IP addresses, such as IPs reserved for VPNs or Tor. [DuckDuckGo](#duckduckgo) and [Brave Search](#brave-search) are friendlier options if your threat model requires hiding your IP address from the search provider.

Startpage is based in the Netherlands. According to their [privacy policy](https://www.startpage.com/en/privacy-policy/), they log details such as: operating system, type of browser, and language. They do not log your IP address, search queries, or other personally identifying information.

Startpage's majority shareholder is System1 who is an adtech company. We don't believe that to be an issue as they have a distinctly separate [privacy policy](https://system1.com/terms/privacy-policy). The Privacy Guides team reached out to Startpage [back in 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210118031008/https://blog.privacytools.io/relisting-startpage/) to clear up any concerns with System1's sizeable investment into the service. We were satisfied with the answers we received.
