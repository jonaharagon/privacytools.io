Many cloud storage providers require your full trust that they will not look at your files. The alternatives listed below eliminate the need for trust by either putting you in control of your data or by implementing E2EE.

Recomendamos armazenar uma chave de recuperação local em um local seguro, em vez de utilizar a recuperação do iCloud FileVault. question "Looking for Nextcloud?"

    Nextcloud is [still a recommended tool](productivity.md) for self-hosting a file management suite, however we do not recommend third-party Nextcloud storage providers at the moment, because we do not recommend Nextcloud's built-in E2EE functionality for home users.

Proton Drive desktop clients are still in development.
