## Developing

Committing to this repository requires [signing your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) (`git config commit.gpgsign true`) unless you are making edits via the GitHub.com text editor interface. As of August 2022 the preferred signing method is [SSH commit signatures](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification), but GPG signing is also acceptable. You should add your signing key to your GitHub profile.

This website uses [`mkdocs-material-insiders`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/) which offers additional functionality over the open-source `mkdocs-material` project. For obvious reasons we cannot distribute access to the insiders repository. You can install the website locally with the open-source version of `mkdocs-material`:

1. Clone this repository:
    - `git clone https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org.git` (then `cd privacyguides.org`)
    - `git submodule init`
    - `git submodule update docs/assets/brand`
    - `git config gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile .allowed_signers`
2. Install [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (currently only tested with 3.10)
3. Install [dependencies](/Pipfile): `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-static-i18n typing-extensions`
4. Serve the site locally: `mkdocs serve`
    - The site will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
    - You can build the site locally with `mkdocs build`
    - Your local version of the site may be missing functionality, which is expected. If you are submitting a PR, please ensure the automatic preview generated for your PR looks correct, as that site will be built with the production insiders build.

**Team members** should clone the repository with `mkdocs-material-insiders` directly. This method is identical to production:

1. Clone this repository and submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org.git`
2. Enable SSH commit verification with our local [`.allowed_signers`](/.allowed_signers) file: `git config gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile .allowed_signers`
3. Install Python **3.10**
4. Install **pipenv**: `pip install pipenv`
5. Install dependencies: `pipenv install --dev` (install [Pillow and CairoSVG](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/#dependencies) as well to generate social cards)
6. Serve the site locally: `pipenv run mkdocs serve --config-file mkdocs.production.yml` (set `CARDS=true` to generate social cards)
    - The site will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
    - You can build the site locally with `pipenv run mkdocs build`
    - This version of the site should be identical to the live, production version

If you commit to `main` with commits signed with your SSH key, you should add your SSH key to [`.allowed_signers`](/.allowed_signers) in this repo.

## Releasing

1. Create a new tag: `git tag -s v2.X.X -m 'Some message'`
    - [View existing tags](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/tags)
    - Tag [numbering](https://semver.org/): Increment the MINOR (2nd) number when making significant changes (adding/deleting pages, etc.), increment the PATCH (3rd) number when making minor changes (typos, bug fixes). Probably leave the MAJOR number at 2 until a massive revamp (v1 -> v2 was the Jekyll to MkDocs transition).
2. Push the tag to GitHub: `git push --tags`
3. [Create a new release](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/releases/new) selecting the new tag
    - Title the release the same as the tag version number, i.e. `v2.X.X`
      - For more significant releases, add a **short** title, for example [v2.3.0 - Localization Support](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/releases/tag/v2.3.0) or [v2.2.0 - Removing Social Networks](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
    - GitHub should let you auto-generate release notes based on PR titles
      - Mark more significant changes in bold, see [v2.12.0](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/releases/tag/v2.12.0) for example
4. Publish release, it will be deployed to the live site automatically
    - When publishing more significant releases (generally any with a MINOR version increment) check the "Create a discussion for this release" box to post an announcement
