## Developing

Committing to this repository requires [signing your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) (`git config commit.gpgsign true`) unless you are making edits via the GitHub.com text editor interface. As of August 2022 the preferred signing method is [SSH commit signatures](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification), but GPG signing is also acceptable. You should add your signing key to your GitHub profile.

### With `mkdocs-material`

1. Install required packages: `pip install mkdocs-material`
2. Run a local preview of the English site: `mkdocs serve`

### With `mkdocs-material-insiders`

This website uses [`mkdocs-material-insiders`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders) which offers additional functionality over the open-source `mkdocs-material` project. For obvious reasons we cannot distribute access to the insiders repository.

**Team members** should clone the repository with `mkdocs-material-insiders` directly. This method is identical to production:

1. Clone this repository and submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org.git`
2. Enable SSH commit verification with our local [`.allowed_signers`](/.allowed_signers) file: `git config gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile .allowed_signers`
3. Install Python **3.12**.
4. Install **pipenv**: `pip install pipenv`
5. Install dependencies: `pipenv install --dev` (install [Pillow and CairoSVG](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/#dependencies) as well to generate social cards)
6. Serve the site locally: `pipenv run mkdocs serve --config-file mkdocs-production.yml` (set `CARDS=true` to generate social cards)
    - The site will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
    - You can build the site locally with `pipenv run mkdocs build --config-file mkdocs-production.yml`
    - This version of the site should be identical to the live, production version

If you commit to `main` with commits signed with your SSH key, you should add your SSH key to [`.allowed_signers`](/.allowed_signers) in this repo.

## Releasing

It is required to create a GitHub release to publish the current site to privacyguides.org. The current `main` branch can be previewed at [https://main.staging.privacyguides.dev](https://main.staging.privacyguides.dev) prior to release.

1. Create a new tag: `git tag -s YYYY.MM.DD -m 'Some message'`
    - Tag numbering: `YYYY.MM.DD` - if two+ releases are published on the same day, append short commit sha to next release, e.g. `YYYY.MM.DD-6aa14e8`
    - Enable GPG tag signing by default (`git config tag.gpgSign true`) to avoid missing signatures
2. Push the tag to GitHub: `git push --tags`
3. A GitHub Release will be automatically created and deployed to the live site.
    - You may wish to manually check or edit the release changelog/title after it is published for accuracy.
