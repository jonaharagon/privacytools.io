  description="<strong>Proton Drive</strong> is an end-to-end encrypted general file storage service by ProtonMail. It is currently in beta and only is only available through a web client. As such, it is reliant on JavaScript to handle encryption, and you must trust ProtonMail to not inject any malicious JavaScript to get your private key. Consider using a different service if this does not fit your threat model."
