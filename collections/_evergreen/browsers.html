<h2>Browser Fingerprinting - Is your browser configuration unique?</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  Your Browser sends information that makes you unique amongst millions of users and therefore easy to identify.
</div>

<p>When you visit a web page, your browser voluntarily sends information about its configuration, such as available fonts, browser type, and add-ons. If this combination of information is unique, it may be possible to identify and track you without using cookies. EFF created a Tool called <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/" target="_blank">Cover Your Tracks</a> to test your browser to see how unique it is.</p>

<p>
<a class="btn btn-warning" target="_blank" href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">
  Test your Browser now
</a>
</p>

<p>You need to find what <strong>most browsers</strong> are reporting, and then use those variables to bring your browser in the same population. This means having the same fonts, plugins, and extensions installed as the large installed base. You should have a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/">spoofed user-agent string</a> to match what the large userbase has. You need to have the same settings enabled and disabled, such as DNT and WebGL. You need your browser to look as common as everyone else. Disabling JavaScript, using Linux, or even using the Tor Browser Bundle, will make your browser stick out from the masses.</p>

<p>Modern web browsers have not been architected to assure personal web privacy. Rather than worrying about being fingerprinted, it seems more practical to use <a href="#addons"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> free software plugins</a> to regain control. They not only respect your freedom, but your privacy also. You can get much further with these than trying to manipulate your browser's fingerprint.</p>

<h2 id="webrtc" class="anchor">WebRTC IP Leak Test - Is your IP address leaking?</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  WebRTC is a new communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN.
</div>

<p>While software like NoScript prevents this, it's probably a good idea to block this protocol directly as well, just to be safe. <strong>Note:</strong> This disables browser-based call functionality that is used for webapps like Discord, Hangouts, Jitsi, etc.</p>

<p>

<h3>How to disable WebRTC in Firefox?</h3>

<p>In short: Set "media.peerconnection.enabled" to "false" in "about:config".</p>
<p><strong>Explained:</strong></p>

<ol class="long-string-list">
  <li>Enter "about:config" in the firefox address bar and press enter.</li>
  <li>Press the button "I'll be careful, I promise!"</li>
  <li>Search for "media.peerconnection.enabled"</li>
  <li>Double click the entry, the column "Value" should now be "false"</li>
  <li>Done. Do the WebRTC leak test again.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to make sure every single WebRTC-related setting is really disabled change these settings:</p>

<ol class="long-string-list">
  <li>media.peerconnection.turn.disable = true</li>
  <li>media.peerconnection.use_document_iceservers = false</li>
  <li>media.peerconnection.video.enabled = false</li>
  <li>media.peerconnection.identity.timeout = 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can be 100% sure WebRTC is disabled.</p>

<h3>How to disable WebRTC in Safari?</h3>

<p>Safari is far stricter with WebRTC than other major browsers, and it does not leak your IP address in its default configuration. If you'd like, you can follow these steps just to double-check your browser:</p>

<ol class="long-string-list">
  <li>Choose "Preferences" under the Safari menu in your menu bar.</li>
  <li>Select the Advanced tab and check the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" box.</li>
  <li>Exit Preferences and open the Develop menu in your menu bar.</li>
  <li>In the drop-down menu, open the "WebRTC" submenu and ensure "Enable Legacy WebRTC API" is unchecked. If it's grayed out, even better.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to disable WebRTC in Google Chrome?</h3>

<p>WebRTC cannot be fully disabled in Chrome; however, it is possible to change its routing settings (and prevent leaks) using an extension. Two open-source solutions include <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-leak-prevent/eiadekoaikejlgdbkbdfeijglgfdalml">WebRTC Leak Prevent</a> (options may need to be changed depending on the scenario), and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">uBlock Origin</a> (select "Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses" in Settings).</p>

<h3>What about other browsers?</h3>

<p>Chrome on macOS and Internet Explorer do not yet implement WebRTC.</p>
